This is a Notecard Jeopardy App designed to help students create flashcards and use them to play a Jeopardy format game. This provides a fun and interactive way for students to study for tests and quizzes!

I created this app for an IB Computer Science Project and added some extra functionalities to practice my skills. The graphics are currently very poor. Hopefully I will make many graphical and functional improvements in the future.
